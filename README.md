# AtliQ-Hardware-Business-Insight-360
A comprehensive analysis of the Business of AtliQ Hardware
AtliQ Hardware is a fast-growing global company specializing in the manufacturing and retailing of computer accessories. Their product range is distributed through a diverse network, including direct-to-customer channels and third-party retailers. Major retail partners include outlets such as Croma, BestBuy, and Flipkart, with products available both in physical stores (brick-and-mortar) and on e-commerce platforms.
In addition to third-party sales, AtliQ also operates its own retail channels, such as AtliQ e-Store and AtliQ Exclusive outlets. These direct platforms help the company build strong customer relationships and retain higher profit margins. However, due to regulatory or market access restrictions in countries like China and South Korea, AtliQ is unable to sell directly to retailers. Instead, it relies on authorized distributors like Neptune to manage product distribution in those regions.
While AtliQ continues to expand globally and strengthen its market presence, it faces significant challenges:

Losses in Latin America, possibly due to operational inefficiencies or market misalignment.

Intense competition from established players, particularly Dell, in key global markets.

Despite these setbacks, AtliQ is focused on innovation and growth, aiming to solidify its position as a major player in the computer accessories industry.
